## Configuration

On repository for which the application is installed,

```json
{
  "mustMatch": "(.+)"
}
```

- `mustMatch`: one or more [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
- `mustNotMatch`: one or more [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
